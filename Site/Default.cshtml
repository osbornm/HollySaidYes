        <p>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…</p>

        <p>I, this is Matthew, decided I was tired of the same old dating game and decided to join eHarmony. I was lucky enough 
        to be matched with a beautiful woman, Holly who lived in the same city. We chatted back and forth a decent amount as 
        decided that we wanted to go on a full-blown date. When we were working out the details we found out that we oddly lived 
        in the same apartment complex only a few feet from each other, spooky right? We went on our first date, to outback, and 
        had a great time and ended up staying up till almost two in the morning talking and getting to know each other. We went 
        on our first date and had a great time and ended up staying up till almost two in the morning talking and getting to know 
        each other.  Fast-forward six months, we meet each other’s families and we spending almost every moment of every day 
        together. Fast-forward another six months, and we moved in together and somehow managed to not kill each other in the 
        process. Fast-forward a year to present time, I have asked Holly to join me for life and become my wife, but you can read 
        more about that later. No amount of words or pictures can describe the joy I have in my heart and the love that I have 
        for Holly!</p>
